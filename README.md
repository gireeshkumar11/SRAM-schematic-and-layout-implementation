I designed an SRAM which stands for static RAM using 6 transistors popularly called as 6T SRAM cell, in the software called Cadence Virtuoso 90nm technology
Here we can do read write and hold operations for 1 bit storage purposes

These operations are controlled by bit line BL and word lines WL

I also performed the layout implementation of this SRAM cell
The layout focuses on minimum cell area, symmetry, and matching of transistors, as shown in the screenshots
